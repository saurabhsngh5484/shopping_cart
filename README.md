# shopping_cart
Project Features
We’ll be creating a simple shopping cart application using html,css and Advanced JS concepts. The topics we’ll cover include promises, async await , using storage APIs and basic API calls while also dealing with complex DOM Manipulations.
Here’s a list of features that this project includes and you’ll be graded on these points -

Signup and login handle using local storage - multiple users - if not logged in don’t let the person enter the shop or my cart or profile
Fetching of products using api - in the shop page - you can save the products in localstorage as well (Hint)
Filter of items - based on name (search bar), price and rating (sidebar) + (filtering based on colour and size is for bonus - not mandatory but optional )
Shopping cart handle using localstorage (Adding and removing items)
Checkout functionality of my cart - after razorpay.open() delete myCart items and remove it.
Profile page - show data taken using signup and allow user to edit it.
Basic HTML & CSS animations and styling will be tested too
